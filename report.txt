## Title

### 1. Introduction
In this report, we present our work on performing land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite images. 
The purpose of this work is to evaluate the use of simple classification algorithms on the images to validate 
their applicability and achieved results.

### 2. Description of the Process
#### 2.1 Data
We worked with a dataset consisting of 27,000 images with 13 spectral bands representing 10 different land classes. 
For our purposes, we simplified the dataset to images in JPG format with three spectral bands (RGB).

#### 2.2 Descriptive data Analyse 
In our descriptive data analysis, we conducted a number of analyses to gain insight into the dataset. 
First, we quantified the number of images in each folder, which provides an understanding of the balance or 
imbalance between different land classes. Next, we examined the dimensions of each image to ensure consistency and 
and compatibility for subsequent analyses. We also visualised five random images from each folder, 
This allowed us to explore the diversity of images and landscapes within the dataset. 
Finally, we computed histograms of the red, green and blue channels for each image, allowing us to visualise the distribution of pixel intensities and understand the 
distribution of pixel intensities and understand the colour composition and intensity variations across the dataset. 

#### 2.3 Image Processing
We performed necessary preprocessing of the images, including scaling to a fixed size, normalization, 
and potentially removing noise.

#### 2.4 Dataset Preparation
The dataset was split into training and test sets to properly evaluate the models. 
An analysis of the class distribution was also conducted to ensure adequate training.

#### 2.5 Model Configuration
We implemented three classification models: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and k-NN. 
These models were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.
