## Title

### 1. Introduction
In this report, we present our work on performing land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite images. 
The purpose of this work is to evaluate the use of simple classification algorithms on the images to validate 
their applicability and achieved results.

### 2. Description of the Process
#### 2.1 Data
We worked with a dataset consisting of 27,000 images with 13 spectral bands representing 10 different land classes. 
For our purposes, we simplified the dataset to images in JPG format with three spectral bands (RGB).

#### 2.2 Image Processing
We performed necessary preprocessing of the images, including scaling to a fixed size, normalization, 
and potentially removing noise.

#### 2.3 Dataset Preparation
The dataset was split into training and test sets to properly evaluate the models. 
An analysis of the class distribution was also conducted to ensure adequate training.

#### 2.4 Model Configuration
We implemented three classification models: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and k-NN. 
These models were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.
